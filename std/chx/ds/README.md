## TODO 
* Printf doesn't belong here, and there's also a chx Printf. Need to pick one
* XYMap is an old 2d array from 2008... evaluate that vs. Array2
* AssociativeArray may duplicate functionality in another class here
* check all exceptions
* unify chx.ds.tools/Assert.hx (Michael) with /Assert.hx (Russell). /Assert.hx is as old as I am now, but still functions, and was coded before all the new macro.* functions were available
